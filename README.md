# The Small Belligerent Foreign Country Extension

## Overview

"The Small Belligerent Foreign Country" (SBFC) is a Chrome-based browser extension that probabilistically replaces Israel-related keywords on a webpage with alternative terms to remind the reader that Israel is not actually part of the United States.

The extension is intended as **political satire**, and should not be taken too seriously or misinterpreted.

- Enable **Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

### 4. Load the Extension

## Viewing the Source Code

If you'd like to inspect the source code to verify the behavior of the extension, you can do so by checking out the `src/` folder of the repository. This folder contains the uncompiled source code, including:

- **background.js**: The background script using service workers.
- **content.js**: The content script that runs on the web pages.
- **options.jsx**: The React-based options page.

## Building the Extension Yourself (Optional)

If you'd like to verify that the `dist/` folder matches what is generated from the source code, or you just want to build the extension yourself, you can follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

To build the extension yourself, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This comes bundled with Node.js.

### Steps to Build the Extension

1. **Download the Source Code**:
   - You can download the source code by clicking the green **Code** button on the repository's main page, and selecting **Download ZIP**, or clone it using Git:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/koenswinkelswfw/the-small-belligerent-foreign-country.git
     ```

2. **Install the Necessary Build Tools**:
   - The project uses Webpack to bundle the JavaScript files and Babel to transpile modern JavaScript/JSX into a format that can run in the browser.
   
   - After downloading or cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (Webpack, Babel, and others):

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   This will install all dependencies defined in the `package.json`, including:
   - **Webpack**: For bundling the files.
   - **Babel**: For transpiling React (JSX) and modern JavaScript.
   - Other dependencies used during the build process.

3. **Build the Extension**:
   - After the dependencies are installed, you can build the extension by running:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

   This command will use Webpack to bundle the code and output the result into the `dist/` folder.

4. **Verify the Build**:
   - You can now compare the `dist/` folder you generated with the one included in the repository. You can use file comparison tools like `diff` (Linux/macOS) or [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/) (Windows) to ensure there are no differences between the two folders.

### Optional: Load the Built Extension in Chrome
If you'd like to load the extension you just built, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
2. Enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select your newly built `dist/` folder.
